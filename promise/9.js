// # Can you do what async does?

// When doing asynchronous programming you will often want to
// perform multiple operations in parallel.  In some cases
// you may wish to delay further processing until a list of
// async operations have completed.

// In synchronous code this is trivial because our operations
// are executed in the order they are specified:

//     var thingOne = getThing(1);
//     var thingTwo = getThing(2);

//     combine(thingOne, thingTwo);

// We would like to build a function such that we can specify a list
// of asynchronous values we would like to fetch and then use once all
// are available.

//     getAll([fetch(1), fetch(2)])
//     .then(function (first, second) {
//       console.log(first, second);
//     });

// ## Task

// Let's build this function!

// 1) Construct two promises using Q's defer()
// 2) Construct a function all that accepts two promises as arguments.
//    Your function should:

//    a) Create an internal promise using Q's defer() and return it!
//    b) Create a counter variable with initial value of 0.
//    c) Attach then fulfillment handlers to both promises which increment an internal counter
//    d) if the counter reaches 2, fulfill the internal promise with an array
//       containing both values.
//    e) Also attach rejection handlers to both promises which both reject the internal promise!

// 3) Pass your two promises into your new function and then attach console.log as
//    a fulfillment handler to the promise returned by your function.
// 4) Attach a function to setTimeout that resolves both of the promises you created
//    and passed to your function with the values "PROMISES" and "FTW", respectively.
//    Set the timeout delay to 200ms.

// TIP: Don't forget to pass the promise attribute of your deferreds!

// If your function is successful it should print out ["PROMISES", "FTW"] which is
// just someone's opinion man!

// ## Bonus

// Try using Q's all method to replace your function.  Note that their implementation
// expects you to pass it an array of promises, not as individual arguments.

// ## Super Bonus

// Try using Q's spread method to replace your then handler on the promise returned
// by all.  Note that spread will return individual arguments, which should affect
// your output slightly!

// Q.all, .spread, etc are just some of the many promise utility functions that many
// promise libraries make available or that you can easily build for yourself.  The
// composability of promises (due to them being re-ified objects) is a huge upside
// and you can quickly discover many amazing patterns for building async systems.
